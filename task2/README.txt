CAPP 30123: Final Project


This is the second task of big data analysis: flows of weather change


Steps taken:

1. MapReduce: find records with big temperature difference
    1.1 Pair records with the records of the same location of 24 hours ago, to calculate the 24-hour temptation difference.
    1.2 Select only the records with big temperature differences, and reduce the hourly data into daily data by taking averages of temperature differences and direction of wind.
    1.3 Export the initial results into a file.

2. (Optional) Separate the file of initial results
    2.1 Extract data of the assigned year.
    2.2 Extract data of the assigned direction of temperature change (increase/decrease).

3. MapReduce: find flows of temperature change
    3.1 Pairwise comparison among records
    3.2 Export linked records


Files:

1. Mapdiff.py

This file is used to generate temp diff that larger then 80 with MapReduce

Use MapReduce to find different stations that experience same trend in the similar time duration, for example, 7 days.

Save the results into txt/csv file

Run it using:
    python3 Mapdiff.py --jobconf mapreduce.job.reduces=1 data.csv > results.txt

2. seperate_file.py

This file is used to seperate the large datafile generated by the first MapReduce into smaller bins, in order to reduce complexity of computation.

Change values of the two "if"s to extract corresponding records.

Run it using:
    python3 seperate_file.py --jobconf mapreduce.job.reduces=1 results.csv > results_selected.txt

3. getpair.py

This file is used to do the second MapReduce of pairwise comparison. Its purpose is to find linked records.

Input:
    a data file containing records with big temperature changes. Could be the file of all records, or the file for a subset of data.

Run it using:
    python3 getpair.py --jobconf mapreduce.job.reduces=1 results.csv > flows.txt

4. count.py

This file is used to extract information to plot all the temperature changes along the 10 years.
